Just hit ctrl+c after putting this into your repository program

Comes out with

Unable to create '/repository/.git/index.lock': File exists.

Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue.
Everything up-to-date

index.lock doesnt exist, not even as a hidden file, but it might be one of those zone trackers I've been noticing that they attach onto certain machine learning files. dir /r finds them in windows, no idea in linux


Useful with CertSurf or SilCertSurfer as its constantly making port readout files.


Trying stopping the processes, no luck on it working, though manually updating the github repository without the program still works. As in Code in Terminal still allows terminal updating repository

ps -elf will show the running unhinged processes to kill, but killing them still has the problem up, again just still works in terminal, its just the sigint code which finds if anyone tries to hit ctrl+c to end the process or copy something down and updates the server. Might be an interesting aspect if you're gonna leave a server running in like a movie scenario, where the program seemingly is hacking everyone and the person there to stop the hack releases their own ip address or something onto a github server.
