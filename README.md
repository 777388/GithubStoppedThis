Just hit ctrl+c after putting this into your repository programU

Comes out with

Unable to create '/repository/.git/index.lock': File exists.

Another git process seems to be running in this repository, e.g.
an editor opened by 'git commit'. Please make sure all processes
are terminated then try again. If it still fails, a git process
may have crashed in this repository earlier:
remove the file manually to continue.
Everything up-to-date

index.lock doesnt exist, not even as a hidden file, but it might be one of those zone trackers I've been noticing that they attach onto certain machine learning files.
